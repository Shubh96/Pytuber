# Pytuber
I am sure, everyone is a fan of **YouTube** and truly so, for there is everything there, starting from *Entertainment* to *Educational* videos. But it may, at times happen that you don't have access to internet and you immediately need to re-refer to something that you had watched earlier. Well, for that the only good option is that, either you have the videos downloaded in your device, the most important ones; for which either you would have to visit some pages having advertisements all over them and pop-ups opening on click or you may have to download and install some software or application to your device. Who takes that much of an headache, not me, to be true.

_**Pytuber**_ a minimalist application I developed using a little bit of Python scripting serves the purpose for you really well. It doesn't have any crimpy ads nor do you need to install it. Just run the application when needed and close it when task is accomplished.
